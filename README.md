# FilePathInDatabaseProject
This is a demo project how I want to audit CRUD data operations in a database project. This works with local publish but in AzureDevOps I don't have aceess to the $SolutionDir macro.

I created this repo to help out explaining ["How do you reference a sql script (not procedure) in a Script.PostDeployment.sql in Azure DevOps?"](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/800125/how-do-you-reference-a-sql-script-not-procedure-in.html) problem I'm having with database project build in AzureDevOps
